This is a place to collaborate on projects, that are being build upon the Cuvis SDK and work with Cubert Hyperspectral Cameras.
The repositories are aimed at professionals, researchers and students alike. The Cuvis-SDK repository contains everything you need to connect and integrate Cubert hyperspectral cameras into your processing pipeline in various programming languages. Even without a camera, you can start straight ahead with the demo data provided.

Additionally we provide classification engines in C++/CUDA and Python. Both are designed to work efficiently and transparently on cubert hyperspectral data cubes.
The engines let you train, process and evaluate your dataset and the resulting model can easily be deployed in the field.
