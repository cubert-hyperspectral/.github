# cuvis.hub

This is a place to __collaborate on projects__, that are being build upon the __Cuvis SDK and work with Cubert Hyperspectral Cameras.__
These __open-source__ repositories are aimed at __professionals, researchers and students__ alike. The Cuvis-SDK repository contains __everything you need to connect and integrate Cubert hyperspectral cameras__ into your processing pipeline in various programming languages. Even without a camera, you can start straight ahead with the __demo data provided__.

Additionally we provide __classification engines in C++/CUDA and Python__. Both are designed to work efficiently and transparently on cubert hyperspectral data cubes.
The engines let you __train, process and evaluate__ your dataset and the resulting model can __easily be deployed__ in the field.
